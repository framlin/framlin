text=PageHistory displays a summary of past edits on a page. Each past edit is shown in a box which shows lines added, changed or deleted during that edit in a before & after format.²²Below each box is a "Restore" link. Clicking the link will open an edit box with the page as it was ''before'' that edit.  You can make changes or simply click Save to restore the text.²²There are two additional options specific to Page''''History:²* '''Hide minor edits''' - hides any edit that the author marked as 'minor'.²* '''Show changes to markup'''- shows changes to the markup (as opposed to the normal display which shows changes to the output).²²A page's history is kept for the number of days given by the $DiffKeepDays variable (set by the site's WikiAdministrator).  When a page is edited, any page history information older than this value is automatically discarded.²²%trail% <<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>²²hello - i hope someone can help me here - i am running pmwiki - and everything is great except it doesn't keep the history of the pages and so i cannot restore to the older versions of the page - it always loads the most recent - it keeps track of the number of pages and dates of changes though²²If you're running under Windows, see WinDiff.
