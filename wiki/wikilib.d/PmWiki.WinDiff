text=->%note% This package is probably no longer needed as of pmwiki 1.0.11, which includes a PHP-implementation of ''diff'' in the ''scripts/phpdiff.php'' file.²²PmWiki uses the external program ''diff'' to store previous versions of pages.  While these programs are commonly available on most Unix systems, they are generally not available under Windows.²²WinDiff (http://www.pmichaud.com/pub/windiff/windiff.zip) is a special package containing Windows versions of the  ''diff'' and ''patch'' programs from the [[http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32 Gnuwin32 project]].  To use this package, simply create a ''windiff/'' subdirectory in the directory that holds your ''pmwiki.php'' script and copy the files from the [[http://www.pmichaud.com/pub/windiff/windiff.zip zip archive]] into that directory.  Then, add the following lines to your ''local/config.php'' file:²²    $SysDiffCmd = 'windiff\\diff';²    $SysPatchCmd = 'windiff\\patch --silent';²²    ²That should be all there is to it!  Questions and comments can be sent to mailto:pmwiki-users@pmichaud.com.²²----²²Those with [=MSys=] already installed may find the following config lines helpful:²²    $SysDiffCmd = 'C:/msys/1.0/bin/diff.exe';²    $SysPatchCmd = 'C:/msys/1.0/bin/patch.exe';²²----²Thx! I also make my copy of Tavi on Win32 works with Diff now!²(i.e. Tavi works with the Diff from PmWiki's but not from [[http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/ GNU utilities for Win32]] nor [[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm Gnuwin32 project]])²-- AaronLaw , 2004-06-26 10:50²²--- ²this solution WILL NOT work on the windows 2003 servers that will not allow foreign programs to work under IIS 6. ²you have to use php (sript versions) of difff and patch²please find it here:²http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/PHPDiffEngine²²---- ²Failure to install a valid diff and patch application can cause a DOS window to open with the message "The system could not find the specified path." which may also appear in your error logs.  The reason is that the php engine is looking for diff and patch in /usr/bin which does not exist.  This is true, even if the "recent changes" function continues to work.[[<<]]²-- Mark Goldey
