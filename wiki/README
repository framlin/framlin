Welcome to PmWiki.

The local/ subdirectory is a good place to put your local PmWiki site
configuration files and scripts.  It's better to put your customizations
and modifications here than to directly edit the files in the scripts/ 
subdirectory, so that PmWiki updates won't accidentally overwrite your
modifications.

This is pmwiki-1.0.11.
